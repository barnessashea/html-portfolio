<h1>The Best New Movies of 2023</h1>
<h2>My Top 3 Movies of the summer.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Guardians of the Galaxy Vol.3</h3>
<p>I love this movie because of the amazing graphic details and the solid storyline.  This movie is definitely a step up from the first two volumes.</p>
<h3>The Mother</h3>
<p>The Mother is hands down one of my favorites because of the non stop action.  I love a good thriller with plenty of guns.</p>
<h3>They Cloned Tyrone</h3>
<p>I love this movie because it's technically a documentary of what's going on here in the U.S.</p>
